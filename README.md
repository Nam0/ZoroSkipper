# ZoroSkipper

ZoroSkipper is a Firefox extension I made because I want to fall asleep watching pirated anime like a pleb. It should work with most streaming sites; you might need to mess around with the options some.

## Features

- Auto Start
- Auto Skip to next episode
- Full Screen (With F11 because it's kinda jank)
- Customizable Options

## Installation

- Download from Mozilla Add-ons [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/zoroskipper/).

## Usage

- You should be ready to go right off the bat on Zoro SE as long as it's playing on the vStream server.
- You might need to change the settings if it isn't. I might add a feature to figure it out automatically.

## Supported Sites

- Currently supports Zoro SE and vStream (embTaku), but you can adjust the settings to make it work with other sites.

## Development

- Clone the repo and follow the install guide.
- Make changes and push them.
- If you're smarter than I am and know a workaround for Chrome autoplay, please do so!!!

## License

I don't really know licensing stuffâ€”don't pay for it and don't sell it. If you can help with this, please do; if not, ah well.

## Contact

Message me through issues [here](https://github.com/Nam0/ZoroSkipper/issues), and I'll probably take a look.
